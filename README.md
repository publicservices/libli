# library list 

library list is a experimental [Matrix](https://matrix.org) client,
fork of[cerulean](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/18/introducing-cerulean)
(and [r4.cerulean](https://github.com/internet4000/r4-cerulean)).

## Usage

- register an account through the website, or any other matrix client;
  you can use the server `matrix.org` or `dendrite.matrix.org`, two public
  instances of matrix
- login, and start posting; the posts go to your user's public timeline
- you can view and edit your activity in [app.element.io](https://app.element.io) with the same user (and server!).

## help

Comme chat through matrix
[matrix.to/#publicservices:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#publicservices:matrix.org)
for any question.

## Why?

This is a test to see what can be done with Matrix.

It seems Matrix can be used as replacement backend for many type of
applications, and simple clients (like this one) can plug on top to
help manage and present the data to users.

There seem to be a lot of possibilities, putting the user back in
control of their data.

## Development

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
